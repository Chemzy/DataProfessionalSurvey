# DataProfessionalSurvey
The survey of data professionals involves transforming and cleaning the data in Power BI using Power Query, creating visualizations, and finalizing the dashboards. The survey includes various questions related to the respondents' roles, career transitions into data, salary, industry, programming language preferences, job satisfaction, difficulty breaking into the data field, job priorities, gender, age, country of residence, and education level. By leveraging Power BI's data transformation capabilities and visualization tools, the data professionals can gain valuable insights from the survey responses and generate meaningful visual representations of the data. This project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and dashboard development using Power BI.
